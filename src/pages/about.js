            I pride myself on being a user-driven design technologist with a

            With education in both Computer Engineering and Human-Centered
            Design, I can speak researcher, designer, and developer â€“ and I
            thrive most when I can use this perspective to improve team
            collaboration and produce truly outstanding experiences.

            On the technical side, I am well-versed in the modern web and have a
            specific fondness for React (and more recently, React Native). I am
            known for ramping up to projects <i>fast</i> and tackling ambiguity
            with a steady, analytical approach.

            As might already be obvious, I like variety in my work. But my sweet
            spot is coding interactive prototypes and proof-of-concepts that can
            be used to refine and test mid-process ideas and help them reach
            their fullest potential.
